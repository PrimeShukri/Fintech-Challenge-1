## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?



* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?



* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Global Payments Inc. has several unique offerings that set it apart from its competitors and give it an unfair advantage in the payments industry.
Firstly, the company has a strong focus on innovation and research and development. Global Payments Inc. invests heavily in technology and software solutions, allowing it to create cutting-edge products and services that its competitors may not be able to match. For example, the company's Global Payments Integrated platform offers a wide range of features, such as fraud detection and prevention, data analytics, and reporting, that are not always available from other payment processors.
Secondly, Global Payments Inc. has a broad global presence, serving customers in over 100 countries worldwide. This global reach allows the company to offer customized payment solutions tailored to specific regional needs and regulations. For example, the company's partnerships with local banks and financial institutions allow it to offer local payment options that may not be available from its competitors.
Thirdly, the company has a strong focus on mergers and acquisitions, allowing it to expand its offerings and reach a wider customer base. For example, its acquisition of Total System Services (TSYS) in 2019 gave Global Payments Inc. a stronger presence in the United States and allowed it to offer more comprehensive services to its customers.
Finally, Global Payments Inc. is committed to corporate social responsibility and sustainability, which has become increasingly important to consumers and businesses. The company's initiatives in this area, such as its goal to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2025 and its Global Diversity and Inclusion Council, set it apart from its competitors and may attract customers who prioritize social responsibility in their business relationships.
Overall, Global Payments Inc.'s focus on innovation, global reach, mergers and acquisitions, and corporate social responsibility give it an unfair advantage over its competitors in the payments industry.
