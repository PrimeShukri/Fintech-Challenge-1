GPN is a Fortune 500 company and a member of the S&P 500 with worldwide reach spanning over 170 countries throughout North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Latin America. This company is headquartered in Georgia with nearly 24,000 team members worldwide. It is a leading entity within the domain of payment it’s technology delivers innovative software and services to its customers.

* When was the company incorporated and who are the founders of the company?

Global Payments Inc. was founded in 1967 by four entrepreneurs - Ralph "RJ" Dangelmaier, Robert "Bob" O. Jones, David R. Lovejoy, and B. H. "Bernie" Arogeti. 

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

At the time of its foundation, the Global Payment Inc company was known as National Data Corporation (NDC) and focused primarily on providing data processing services to the healthcare industry. Over the years, NDC expanded into other industries, including payment processing, and changed its name to Global Payments Inc. in 2001 to reflect its growing focus on the payment processing industry. Today, Global Payments Inc. is a leading provider of payment technology and software solutions, serving businesses of all sizes in over 100 countries around the world.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Global Payments Inc. is a publicly traded company and as such, it does not rely on traditional funding sources like venture capital or private equity. Instead, the company raises funds through the sale of stocks and bonds to investors in the financial markets. According to publicly available financial statements, Global Payments Inc. has raised over $2.5 billion in debt and equity financing since its founding in 1967. This funding has been used to support the company's growth through acquisitions, investments in technology and infrastructure, and other strategic initiatives. In recent years, Global Payments Inc. has also generated significant cash flow from its core payment processing business, which has allowed the company to reinvest in its operations and pursue new growth opportunities without the need for additional funding from external sources.

    Net revenue: This measures the revenue generated by the company after subtracting costs and expenses. Higher net revenue indicates better profitability and cost management.

    Customer acquisition and retention: This measures the number of new customers acquired and the percentage of existing customers that remain with the company over time. Higher customer acquisition and retention rates indicate strong brand recognition, customer loyalty, and effective marketing strategies.

    Payment volume: This measures the total value of payments processed by the company. Higher payment volumes indicate higher transaction sizes and greater revenue potential.
